### Concept
Insecure Self Dressers, experiencing a fashion dilemma, specify an occasion and upload two selfies of themselves, proposing two potential outfits. The 'Dress 2 Impress' community vote for their favourite outfit and feedback is provided on each dilemma. The original Insecure Self Dresser receives a speedy recommendation from the fashion world at large while voters can keep up with current fashion trends and discover how fashionable their tastes really are!
